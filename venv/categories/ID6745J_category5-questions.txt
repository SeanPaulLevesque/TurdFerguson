THE B&O
When it began operations in 1830, the power didn't come from steam but was supplied by these
In April 1930 the B&O added this climate-control feature to certain cars; in 1931, to the whole train
On this board the B&O is found between Atlantic &amp; Illinois
The railroad was founded in 1827 by people trying to compete with this new water route
In 1963 control of the B&O was taken over by the C&O, this railroad
