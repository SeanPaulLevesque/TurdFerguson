BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
Before Jane Fonda, Ben deduced there's more exercise going up &amp; down these than straight walking
As a member of a society that formed to do this, Franklin had to have a number of leather   buckets ready
Franklin said that this device also worked on the top of ships' masts with a wire to the water
Ben felt this "most ancient...game known among men" could teach foresight &amp; caution
Poor Richard's last name
