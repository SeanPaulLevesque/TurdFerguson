RIVER DEEP, MOUNTAIN HIGH
Talk about prime delivery! Each year, this river with depths up to 300' provides 20% of the fresh water entering the ocean
In Colorado Mount Yale rises 14,200'; naturally, this "rival" mount that also got its name in 1869 had to be 200' taller
You can't miss it, it's the 14,400-foot mountain seen in the distance <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-03_J_27.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>
The opening words to "America The Beautiful" were inspired by the view from this peak in the Rockies
The world's deepest river, exceeding 700 feet at its max, it's also Africa's 2nd-longest river at 2,900 miles
