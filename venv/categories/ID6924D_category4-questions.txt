TO PHRASE A COIN
To be merciless to an enemy is to show "no" this coin
To "drop" one of these is to inform on someone, like by calling the cops from an old payphone
Something valueless is "not worth a" this colorful 2-word coin phrase
"Don't take any" of these, like the commemorative souvenirs made for the 1933 Chicago World's Fair
When this alliterative phrase offering to wager money against bakery treats first appeared, the coins were still silver
