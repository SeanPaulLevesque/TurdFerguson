ANTS
Though we call America's the original 13, ants lived in these long before that
Since the queen has but one mating flight, she has no need for these afterwards &amp; chews them off
The echidna, pangolin, &amp; aardvark, for example
Antennae serve ants as organs of all senses except this
Unlike termites, these ants don't eat wood, only chew out holes big enough to "build" their nests
