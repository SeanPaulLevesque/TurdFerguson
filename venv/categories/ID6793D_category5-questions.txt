SHAKESPEARE
The prologue of this romantic tragedy tells us, "A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life"
Shylock's last words in this play are "I am not well; send the deed after me and I will sign it"
In "The Merry Wives of Windsor", this rotund &amp; ribald rogue has a page named Robin
In "Henry VIII" this cardinal's first line is "The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?"
Much of "As You Like It" takes place in this forest
