CRIME &amp; PUNISHMENT TALK
To be sent to "the hole" while in prison is to get this extra type of punishment
The Eighth Amendment forbids "excessive" this; the cash type has been eliminated in some jurisdictions
It used to mean pleasantness of weather; today it means mercy, such as a pardon, by a political leader
A 1986 law criminalized this activity, routing money through third parties to hide the illicit source
Going "up the river" originally meant being sent to this prison north on the Hudson River from New York City
