OPERA SONGS
"Habanera" is the popular name for an aria from this opera about a gypsy woman
"Vesti la giubba" ("put on the costume") is from this clownish work
Sung first by Clara, not by either title character, "Summertime &amp; the livin' is easy" in this 20th century opera
"Liebestod" ("Love-Death") is from this Wagner opera about a pair of doomed lovers
This "Chorus" hammers down in the Verdi opera "Il Trovatore"
