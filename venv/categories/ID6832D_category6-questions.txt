YOU SAY IT'S YOUR BIRTHSTONE
This type of beryl for the merry month of May will leave you green with envy
Think water &amp; semper fi as March marches in with this birthstone
Catch some Zs (well, one) at the end of this aluminum silicate &amp; November stone
June features this; its surface luster is called orient
This precious September stone is known for its blue variety
