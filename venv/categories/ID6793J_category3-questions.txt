FADS &amp; FASHIONS
In 1943 these "suits" were worn with wide-brimmed hats &amp; long chains
This Brazilian bombshell of the 1940s sent America tutti-frutti
To be fashionable, F. Scott Fitzgerald's Bernice did it to her hair
A fad in the '50s was this style of music, an example of which is heard <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/1994-07-18_J_19.mp3">here</a>: "<i>Down the way / Where the nights are gay / And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop / I took a trip on a sailing ship / And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop / But I'm sad to say I'm on my way / Won't be back for many a day / My heart is down</i>"
In 1953 this fad clothing style for men hit 2 inches above the knee
