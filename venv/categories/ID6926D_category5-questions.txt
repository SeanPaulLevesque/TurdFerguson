THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
With the Continental Army, George Washington first heard it read in this city
The National Archives has no record of it being sent to this king whose actions it condemns
The date of this historic event was August 2, 1776
This is the first self-evident truth listed
Roger Sherman on the committee to draft the declaration also helped write this 1781 compact
