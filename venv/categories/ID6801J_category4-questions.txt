STATE EMBLEMS
It sounds like you'd find this state flower of Massachusetts on Plymouth Rock
Its state motto is "North to the Future"; its tree, the Sitka spruce
Its state flower is the Rocky Mountain columbine; its state song, "Where The Columbines Grow"
Its folk dance is the square dance; one of its songs is a waltz
The star garnet is the gem of this "Gem State"
