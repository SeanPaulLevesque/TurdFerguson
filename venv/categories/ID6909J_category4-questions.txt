LEONARDO DA VINCI
In Verrocchio's "Baptism of Christ", parts of the landscape &amp; one of these heavenly beings are by Leonardo
To broaden his knowledge of anatomy, he performed these at a Florence hospital
The mural technique he created for this 1495-97 work hasn't held up very well
His monuments of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio &amp; Francesco Sforza on these animals were never finished
They were left to his disciple Francesco Melzi &amp; stayed together for the most part until 1600
