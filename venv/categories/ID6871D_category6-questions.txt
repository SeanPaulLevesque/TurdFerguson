AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE
On a clock's face, these parts show you the time
The outwardly projecting parts on the rim of a gear or saw
If you face up to your actions, you've done this to the blame, taken responsibility
You can finger a suspect; this other digit means casually turn through the pages of a magazine
An extensive deposit in a rock fissure containing desirable minerals or ore
