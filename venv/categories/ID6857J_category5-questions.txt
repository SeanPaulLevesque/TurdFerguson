FAILURE TO LUNCH
Sorry, everyone! I'm on the diet known as O.M.A.D., short for this; I only eat at 5 p.m.
How did you know that "petit" this means "breakfast" in French without knowing that the word on its own means "lunch"?
I bailed on lunch with a big group; I'm this type of person mentioned in the subtitle of Susan Cain's book "Quiet"
I told you lunch wasn't happening because it's this Jewish day of atonement &amp; I'm fasting
I just found out my wisdom teeth are in this 8-letter condition; they're jammed up so I can't eat lunch
