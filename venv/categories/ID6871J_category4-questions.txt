THESE ARE THE DAYS
January 17 is the day to "Ditch New Year's" these commitments; that sounds about right
"Seinfeld" popularized this Dec. 23 holiday "for the rest of us"
March 26 is make up your own holiday day, so in 2017, Matt McCarthy created this Vulcan blessing day
April 17 / International this Day / 5-7-5...nice
"No" these pieces of clothing day is May 8; Albert Einstein would have reveled in it
