WONDERLAND
The big ending of "Alice in Wonderland" is a bizarre court case over who stole these baked goods
Alice "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or" this object "to take out of it"
A confounded Alice uttered this repetitive phrase when the cake made her grow taller
The Caterpillar sits atop one of these that's as tall as Alice, smoking a hookah
This feline says that unlike a dog, "I growl when I'm pleased and wag my tail when I'm angry"
