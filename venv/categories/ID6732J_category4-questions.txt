RECREATION
Pitch and putt is a shorter version of this game
In this sport, if you "ride a roller coaster" you go up &amp; down the face of a wave
This form of hiking is so named because you carry all of your equipment in a knapsack
This backyard game grew out of an earlier version known as battledore &amp; shuttlecock
Large ones of these are used for acrobatics &amp; jumping; mini ones are good for jogging
