AMPHIBIANS
Tadpoles have these for respiration, frogs don't
Amphibians are the smallest living class of these backboned animals
To control pests, this country put giant toads in cane fields &amp; they became pests, like the rabbit fiasco
The "warts" on a toad's skin are actually these that "sweat out" poison
Amphibians emerged from the sea during this period named for an English county
