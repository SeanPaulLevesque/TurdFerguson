TRAVELING ON THE INTERSTATE
Though the roads aren't connected to the contiguous U.S., this island, with PRI-1, -2 &amp; -3, does have interstates
Talkin' baseball... I-90 bookends are Edgar Martinez Drive in Seattle &amp; the Ted Williams Tunnel in this city
(<a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-09-25_J_22.jpg" target="_blank">Jimmy of the Clue Crew presents by a display monitor.</a>) I-5 runs from the Mexican border all the way up to become Canada's Highway 99, leading into <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-09-25_J_22a.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> city, British Columbia's most populous
I-10 is nearly a mile high east of Tucson but below sea level in this city founded by de Bienville in 1718
It's 2,906 miles on I-80 from San Francisco to Teaneck in this state; good thing we've got a full tank of gas
