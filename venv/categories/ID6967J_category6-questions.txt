I'M ALWAYS ANGRY
If you're this "as a hatter", you're said to be insane
We're coming at you "fast &" this, which can mean angry or at unrestrained speed
It can describe an acrid taste or an acrimonious feeling
In song Monty Python said "God gets quite" this angry word, rhyming it with "great"
This 6-letter word for "to irritate" is properly intransitive: "The insults ____", not "The insults ____ me"
