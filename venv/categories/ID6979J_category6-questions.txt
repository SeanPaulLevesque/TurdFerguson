BEYOND ME
From the Yiddish, it's a word for a decent chap
Idiomatically, when you "take someone's" this, you're evaluating them
A butcher shop, or a nightclub where casual liaisons are the order of the day
This word precedes "mouthed" to mean indecisive in speech
To follow a winding course, like a river
