NOW LISTEN TO ME
I've removed the Flowmaster dBX, this part, from my car's exhaust system, &amp; you're gonna hear me 3 blocks away
I'm going to treat you to this kind of falsetto-&amp;-back singing in the manner of a Tyrolean mountaineer
Stand back! I'm gonna shred on my Telecaster, an electric guitar by this famed instrument maker
I'm snapping celery to make the sound of a breaking bone; I'm one of these movie sound "artists"
I'm whining<span class="nobreak">--</span>not in complaint but to imitate this insect of the genus Aedes
