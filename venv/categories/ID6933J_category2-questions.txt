HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE?
Is it first love, like Jennifer Grey's for Patrick Swayze in this classic movie of summer romance?
Does your fervor rival Mario's for this "fruity" princess as he daringly risks his life for her in video games?
Hopefully, it's as deep as the love shown in the 2014 Budweiser ad about an adopted puppy who bonds with one of these horses
Maybe a love that lasts as long as that of this Beatle &amp; wife Barbara Bach, who have been married almost 40 years
It's deep, like Nick's love for Jess on this Fox sitcom; who wouldn't love a bride with an eyepatch?
