MUSICALS BY SONG LYRICS
"Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme"
"You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you"
"He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist, a pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist"
"They chained me &amp; left me for dead, just for stealing a mouthful of bread"
"On the avenue I'm taking you to..."
