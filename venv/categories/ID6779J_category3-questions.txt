COLE PORTER LYRICS
"You're the Nile, you're the Tow'r of Pisa, you're the smile on" this
Title of the song that says, "From this happy day, no more blue songs, only whoop-dee-doo songs"
"I've got you under my skin, I've got you deep in" this
"Good authors, too, who once knew better words now only use" these words "writing prose, anything goes"
"If you're ever in a jam, here I am, if you're ever in a mess", send this signal
