Unlike large leopards, leopard cats have some of these arranged in rows
Nearly 25% of all mammal species are varieties of these, the only mammals that can fly
Since they never stop growing, the oldest of these pachyderms are usually the largest
Elands, bongos &amp; impalas are 3 types of this animal
Their name is Greek for "river horse", &amp; aptly, they give birth to their young in the water
