READ THE LABEL!
Type of product whose name, not the directions for use, reads "tickle"
Your Kodak film comes in a box that tells you to do this "promptly"
It says his "cleaning agents" will cleanse your kitchen; he just stands there with folded arms
Its back label asks, "Why market this no-nonsense kick-in-the-derriere dressing?"
It's what you'd do with a product labeled "Grandma's Tummy Mint"
