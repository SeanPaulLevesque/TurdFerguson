THE OLD WEST
Gunslinger Billy Claiborne used this "childish" nickname after the original outlaw died
Harry Longbaugh acquired this nickname when he was a teenage outlaw, as Butch could have told you
An attack on the Deadwood stagecoach was 1 of the exciting acts in his Wild West show
The most famous of the Younger Brothers, he toured with carnivals after he was paroled from prison
He was jailed for his part in NYC's Astor Place Riots, not for the hyperbole of his western "dime novels"
