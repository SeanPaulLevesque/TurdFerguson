SONG LYRICS
It was Bernie Wayne who wrote, "There she is" this person, "There she is your ideal!"
"If I were" one of these "and you were a lady, would you marry me anyway?"
"Mrs. Brown you've got" one of these; "girls as sharp as her are something rare"
"Why does the sun go on shining? Why does the sea rush to shore? Don't they know it's" this
"If I ruled the world ev'ry day would be" this day
