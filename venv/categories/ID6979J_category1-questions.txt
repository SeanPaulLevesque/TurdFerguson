I LOVE A PARADE
"Every inch of every float must be covered with flowers or other natural materials" in this California parade
Newport Beach in this California county has a lighted holiday boat parade dating back to 1908
This 2-word military-sounding job is the ceremonial head of a parade
In September 1882 the Knights of this held a giant parade in New York City<span class="nobreak">--</span>the prelude to a new holiday
Traditionally, this country marches first in the Parade of Nations to open the Olympics
