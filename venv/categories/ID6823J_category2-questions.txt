NUMBER, PLEASE
A bar mitzvah traditionally celebrates the coming of age of a boy who is this many years old
The not so fun game of cleaning up after a disgruntled card player has this number in its name
In baseball, the sum of balls &amp; strikes represented by a full count
This number follows "Section" in the name of a housing voucher program for those with low income
The word myriad can refer to any large number of things, or specifically to this big number
