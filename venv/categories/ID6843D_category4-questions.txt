TV THEME SONG LYRICS
"Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won't you be my neighbor?"
"So no one told you life was gonna be this way, your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A."
"Men men men men, manly men men men!"
"You're not the boss of me now &amp; you're not so big"
"Sing me a song of a lass that is gone, say, could that lass be I?"
