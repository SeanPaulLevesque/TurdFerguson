DRAMA
This Oscar Wilde work inspired such musicals as "Oh Ernest" &amp; "Ernest in Love"
His play "Saint Joan" opened in 1923, 3 years after Joan of Arc was canonized
The 2nd &amp; last Pulitzer Prize Tennessee Williams won was for this "feline" drama
After his "Tartuffe" played before Louis XIV, it was promptly banned for three years
The last sound in this play is Nora Helmer's slamming of the downstairs door
