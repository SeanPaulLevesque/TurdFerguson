PIRATE FLAGS
It's the "merry" 2-word name for the skull &amp; crossbones flag
These ships in the Royal Navy flew pirate flags upon surfacing while returning to port after sinking enemy ships during war
A black flag is scary enough, but a pirate ship flying this color flag meant "no quarter given", a very bad omen
A skeleton <a href="https://www.j-archive.com/media/2021-03-19_J_19.jpg" target="_blank">flag</a> is associated with this man &amp; his ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge
Act I of this Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operetta has the lyric "Oh, better far to live and die/ Under the brave black flag I fly"
