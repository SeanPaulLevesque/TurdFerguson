MARINE BIOLOGY
Often found in whales &amp; seals, this is a thick layer of fat deposited below the dermis
Crocodiles &amp; their relatives are unique among reptiles in having 4-chambered ones of these
The skeletons of skates &amp; rays are made of this material rather than bone
Anadromous fish such as salmon migrate up rivers to do this
Their leaps of up to 35' in the air &amp; glides of almost 1000' may be to escape undersea predators
