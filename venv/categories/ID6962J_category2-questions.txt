REAL REVIEWS OF THE NOVEL
Its author shouldn't "waste his strength on such purposeless and unequal doings as these rambling volumes about spermaceti whales"
H.L. Mencken: The "clown Fitzgerald rushes to his death in nine short chapters... this story is obviously unimportant"
"Characterization in general is weak... nor is the commander strongly drawn. Again, the aunts are best... it lacks imagination"
Oh, Heathcliff! "The only consolation which we have in reflecting upon" this Bronte work "is that it will never be generally read"
"The trial and the melodramatic conclusion" of this "seem contrived. But (the) insight into Southern mores is impressive"
