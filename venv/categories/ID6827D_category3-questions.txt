THE MAN, THE POETRY
"i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens...nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands"
"Bells" (interspersed more than 60 times within the poem)
"I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear, those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong"
"Back from the mouth of hell, all that was left of them, left of six hundred"
"The soul of Adonais, like a star, beacons from the abode where the eternal are"
