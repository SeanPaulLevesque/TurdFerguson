OLD TESTAMENT
As a baby he went sailing down the Nile in a basket boat
Milton described him as "eyeless in Gaza"
In order to stop a storm at sea, he told the sailors to throw him overboard
Because he asked God for wisdom &amp; not wealth, he got both
Hannah so fervently prayed for this that Eli the priest thought she was drunk
