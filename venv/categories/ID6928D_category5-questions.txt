THE NORMAN CONQUEST
An English rebel called Hereward the Wake led resistance to this Norman king even after the conquest
Norman knights fought in hauberks, long coats of this bendable armor
This 231-foot-long strip of linen is an important source of knowledge about the conquest
At the decisive Battle of Hastings, the Normans had many more bowmen than the English, &amp; one of them may have hit this king in the eye
The Normans brought the custom of inherited these, like Charpentier; they weren't common in pre-conquest England
