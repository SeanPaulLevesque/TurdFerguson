FIRST LADIES
She won a 1962 Emmy for "A Tour of the White House"
Makes sense that she was the first first lady to appear on a stamp
As played by Sally Field, she laments that all people will remember is "I was crazy and I ruined your happiness"
Our longest-living first lady, she died at age 97 in 1982 &amp; is buried with her husband at his Missouri library
When she became first lady, both her grandmothers, on the Folsom &amp; Harmon sides, got to hear the happy news!
