ANAGRAMS OF EACH OTHER
An organ of sense &amp; a long, distinct period of history
A small, flat portable computer &amp; a fight between 2 armies
A person reaching you by phone &amp; a place in a house to store wine
To hit the books &amp; the condition of old books left unread for years
A performance by a single musician &amp; a single newspaper piece
