MOTHER GOOSE
"March winds &amp; April showers bring forth" these
They were the "three men in a tub"
After "Jack fell down &amp; broke his crown", he "went to bed to mend his head" using brown paper &amp; this liquid
Simon thought he "could not fail" to catch this, "because he had a pinch of salt to put upon his tail"
"Ride a cockhorse to" this destination, "to see fine lady upon a white horse"
