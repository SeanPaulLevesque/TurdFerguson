IT'S THEIR SONG
On the album called "The" this rapper "Show", he performs "Hailie's Song" about his daughter
Subtitled "Anthony's Song", this singer's "Movin' Out" is enough to give you a heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack
In this superhero's "Song", Crash Test Dummies sang, "He stayed in the city, kept on changing clothes in dirty old phone booths"
About a decade after "Your Song", a British superstar had his first name in the title of this "Song"
Michel Legrand had an instrumental hit with this tragic football player's "Song", from a TV movie soundtrack
