SUPERSTITIONS
They say it's bad luck to put this shoe on 1st
Supposedly, a bee can't do this while you're holding your breath
Placing this beneath the bed will cut the pain of childbirth
Sticking a piece of this on the top of a baseball cap brings good luck to the team
Dark-colored socks with this color toes protect you from being tripped by elves
