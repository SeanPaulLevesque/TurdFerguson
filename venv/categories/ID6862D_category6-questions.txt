(<a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-09_DJ_30.jpg" target="_blank">Ken Jennings presents the clue.</a>)  The giant <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-09_DJ_30a.jpg" target="_blank">larvacean</a>, which looks like a tadpole surrounded by a balloon of mucus, helps battle climate change; disproportionate to its small size, the gelatinous animals, with their protein &amp; cellulose snot palaces, have helped the ocean remove this planet-warming gas from the atmosphere
(<a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-09_DJ_19.jpg" target="_blank">Ken Jennings presents the clue.</a>)  Though its name is a byword for "crowding", <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-09_DJ_19a.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> fish is vulnerable to steep reductions in numbers; overfishing closed the famed Cannery Row, &amp; in 2014, its Pacific grounds were closed after its populations reduced by about 90%

(<a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-09_DJ_21.jpg" target="_blank">Ken Jennings presents the clue.</a>)  Some species of <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-09_DJ_21a.jpg" target="_blank">shrimp</a> dig burrows that provide shelter for goby fish which, in turn, act as lookout for the nearly blind shrimp; it's an example of mutualism, which, of the main types of this relationship, is the one where both parties benefit
(<a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-09_DJ_24.jpg" target="_blank">Ken Jennings presents the clue.</a>)  Marine biology with a touch of military history: during World War II, Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientists identified a <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-09_DJ_24a.jpg" target="_blank">crustacean</a> whose noises were interfering with the detection of these enemy vessels
