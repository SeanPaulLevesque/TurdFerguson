MUSICAL IDIOMS TO MY EARS
If something triggers a strong emotional response, it might "strike" one of these harmonic note combos
To do things your own way &amp; disregard convention is to "march to" this sound
Playing this stringed instrument means to take a subordinate role

To make yourself look good, sometimes you have to do this, sound a brass instrument with a flared bell
