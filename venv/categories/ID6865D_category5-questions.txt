WARM WORDS
It follows "dead" in a race with no clear winner
Like a passionate affair, a zone of the Earth between the tropics is called this "T" word
In the book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar tosses 3 men into this alliterative "furnace"
This word for an updraft of warm air is from the Greek for "heat"
It can mean both crazy &amp; pleasantly warm, like a mild tropical climate
