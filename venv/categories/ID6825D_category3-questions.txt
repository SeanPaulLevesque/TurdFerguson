THE APOSTLES
This apostle was not present when Jesus first reappeared after the crucifixion, so he had his doubts
Matthias beat out Barsabas in a lottery to replace this apostle who was not a good team player
This man wasn't one of the 12, but he has "The Apostle" for his epithet &amp; much of the Acts of the Apostles is about him
There were 2 Apostles with this name, so we use "the Greater" &amp; "the Less" to tell them apart
