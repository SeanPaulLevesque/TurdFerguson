BRITISH GOVERNMENT
Acts of Parliament &amp; other conventions &amp; court decisions make up what is called Britain's "unwritten" this document
A vote of this in life means someone believes in you; a vote of no this in Parliament means it might be time for a new government
Britain's standard V.A.T., short for this, is 20% for most goods &amp; services
In your house, it's the 2-word room for your computer &amp; paperwork; in Britain, it's a department of domestic affairs
In 2006 in the British House of Lords the job of Lord this was largely replaced by Lord Speaker
