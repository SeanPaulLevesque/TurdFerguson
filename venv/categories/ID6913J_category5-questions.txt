SOUNDS LIKE THE MOVIE'S SEQUEL
This 1984 film based on a Frank Herbert novel was not a prequel to "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain"
This 2019 all-star whodunnit was not a follow-up to the documentary "Forks Over Knives"
"The Host", starring Saoirse Ronan, did not have this Korean import &amp; Best Picture Oscar winner as its sequel
The movie "Looking for" him, also the name of a candy bar, was not a sequel to "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory"
Sounds fitting, but "Singin' in the Rain" was not the first in a series with these "of Cherbourg"
