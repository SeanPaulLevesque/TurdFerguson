NECK &amp; NECKING
The longest nerve on any land creature runs inside the neck of this animal
In 1996 Dale Jarrett initiated the "kissing of the bricks" at the finish line of this city's famed racetrack
"Go for" this main vein in the neck that drains blood from the brain
Neck ribs on the cobra expand to form a formidable one of these, named for head coverings
