HISTORY ACCORDING TO HERODOTUS
The ancient "Father of History" aka "Father of Lies", Herodotus said in India, ants bigger than foxes dig for this precious metal
Herodotus wrote that this ancient capital on the Euphrates was so big it had 100 gates (it had 8)
Skeptical for once, Herodotus doubted the accuracy of this poem, questioning why Greeks would fight for so long over one woman
Many historians doubt that Herodotus visited Egypt, but he still gave a detailed description of this embalming process
Herodotus claimed that only 192 Greeks were killed but 6,400 of these invading foes died at the Battle of Marathon... hmmm
