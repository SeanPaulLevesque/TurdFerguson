A NAPOLEON COMPLEX
Napoleon had intended the <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-12-08_DJ_07.jpg" target="_blank">Madeleine</a> to be a temple to his Grande Armée, but the monarchy made it into one of these in 1816
At one time this Paris museum was named Le Musée Napoléon
It should have been a bad omen for Napoleon when this wife of his bought Malmaison, the house of misfortune
Napoleon started 2 of these structures, the big one at the end of the Champs-Élysées &amp; another "du Carrousel"
Napoleon did not build Les Invalides, but it ended up as his tomb after his body was moved from this island in 1840
