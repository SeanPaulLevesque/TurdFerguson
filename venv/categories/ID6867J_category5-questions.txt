In 1 Corinthians 13 they're described as tinkling; we think of them as clashing
The trumpets that helped knock down Jericho were these animal horns
Saul found David after he was told to seek out a "cunning player" of this instrument
Among several instruments mentioned in Daniel, this stringed one's name means "sweet song"
