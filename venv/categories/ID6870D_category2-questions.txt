ANIMAL ETYMOLOGY
No surprise, this animal's name is from Greek for "8-footed"
From Malay for "man of the forest", this primate lives in the tropical rain forests of Sumatra
The reindeer also goes by this Native American name meaning "shoveler of snow", from its habit of shoving snow aside to feed
Though it's really a mammal, its name is from Latin for "pig fish"
Though wide awake now, <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-11-18_DJ_28.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> critter is thought to get the first part of its name from a word for "sleep"
