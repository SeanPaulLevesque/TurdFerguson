MINCED OATHS
There were 6 British kings named this, but saying "By" him actually meant "By God"
This "sticky" oath, a variant of "damnation", goes back to 1790 &amp; may be derived from "eternal"
This, also the surname of  a prolific 19th c. British author, was sometimes substituted for "devil" in oaths
Instead of referencing the almighty's son, this rhyming phrase with the same initial letters was used
On St. Patrick's Day, you might hear someone exclaim "Faith &" this word meaning "by God"
