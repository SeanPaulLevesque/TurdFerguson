HITTITES
The Hittites entered history in the 2nd millennium B.C. in Anatolia, today the Asian portion of this nation
Reliefs show the Hittites with the wheels on these vehicles moved from the back to the middle, so a third warrior could ride
In Hittite mythology, Ubelluri held up the Earth, just like this Titan
Written soon after a king died of this disease, a prayer named for it asks, will it "never be eliminated from the land of Hatti?"
Most of what we know about the Hittites comes from clay tablets found at Bogazkoy bearing this wedge-shaped writing system
