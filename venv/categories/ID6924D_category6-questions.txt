NO. 1 RECORD
Going low, Meghan Trainor was "All About That" this in a 2014 No. 1
In 1994 this R&B group spent 14 weeks at No. 1 singing, "I'll make love to you, like you want me to"
This 1998 Cher megahit with a 1-word title took 6 songwriters &amp; almost a decade to put together
Despite the fact that "We had joy, we had fun, we had" this title in 1974, it really is one seriously depressing tune
About 20 years after Ray Charles hit No. 1 with this tune, it became a state song
