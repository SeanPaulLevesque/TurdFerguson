SILENT "L"
In the Christmas carol "Silent Night", "all is" this, "all is bright"
These creatures swim hundreds of miles upriver from the Pacific to spawn
Part of your lower leg, or a baby black Angus
There's a silent L in this word for silently sneaking up on prey
"To act on" someone's this is to represent their interests
