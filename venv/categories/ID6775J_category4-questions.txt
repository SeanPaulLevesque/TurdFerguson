SONG LYRICS
In a song from "Okhaloma!", "Everythin's up to date in" this city that's not in Oklahoma
"By the light of" this "I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune"
"Many a heart is aching, if you could read them all; many the hopes that have vanished, after" this
"I'm just a kid again doin' what I did again singing a song" when this happens
"Not a soul down on the corner, that's a pretty certain sign, that those wedding bells are" doing this
