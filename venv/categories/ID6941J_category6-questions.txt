"LONG" SONGS
At the 1984 Olympic closing, this Lionel Richie song came up hours short of its title promise
No mention of the poet is mentioned in this 1978 Neil Diamond "Serenade"
This comparative was the one-word title of a 1980 Dan Fogelberg hit
The Beatles' aptly named last # hit, since they'd reached the end of one by 1970
Other than a bass, the only instrument used in this 1984 Billy Joel song was his voice
