YANKEE STADIUM
In 2009 Jorge Posada hit the first HR in the new Yankee Stadium; in 1923 the first in the old park was, naturally, hit by this man
All rise! On June 11, 2017, a ball landed in the bleachers 495' from home plate, off the bat of this 6'7" Yankee
It wasn't just baseball at the old stadium; this Frank Gifford team moved there in 1956 &amp; promptly won a championship
Stadium swan songs include this immortal center fielder's, getting the Yanks' only hit off Luis Tiant Sept. 25, 1968
A museum at the stadium has statues of World Series hero Don Larsen &amp; 60' 6" away, this great Yankee
