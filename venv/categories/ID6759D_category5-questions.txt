THE NEW TESTAMENT
Matthew 3 begins with this man "preaching in the wilderness of Judaea"
The shepherds were told how to recognize Jesus: he'd be the baby wrapped in these
Mark 3 says Jesus ordained this many people &amp; gave them the power to cast out devils
The epistles to his colleagues Timothy &amp; Titus are called the pastoral epistles
Following the crucifixion, he provided his own tomb for Jesus
