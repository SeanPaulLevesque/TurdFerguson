DOGS
It's considered a dog's most acute sense
This short, brown-eyed, slow-moving dog's name may be from the French "bas", for low
Tho called "old", this shaggy-haired British herding breed developed only about 150 years ago
It's also called the "sleeve dog", as Chinese owners carried them in their sleeves
The Maltese Falcon is black &amp; the Maltese dog is always this color
