THE ERA OF GOOD FEELINGS
The Era of Good Feelings was a period of post-war calm in the early 19th century, mostly during this man's presidency
The Era was a time of building roads &amp; these aqueous transport arteries, such as the Lehigh one
The Era had little political strife due to the self-destruction of this political party at the end of the War of 1812
The relative calm of the Era made it possible to create the second of these institutions, later savaged by Andrew Jackson
Florida became an American territory due to the first of these wars in 1817 &amp; 1818
