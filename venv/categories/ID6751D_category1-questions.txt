MONSTERS
A drug turns this man into the monster Hyde
Among the Chinese this reptilian monster is a symbol of good fortune
This poem tells of a Scandinavian prince who rids the Danes of the monster Grendel
The Thebans made Oedipus king for ridding them of this monster
Krishna, the 8th avatar of this god, slew or defeated scores of evil demons &amp; monsters
