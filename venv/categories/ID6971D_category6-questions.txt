LOSING U
A British currency loses its "U" &amp; becomes this
An artificial water channel drops its "U" &amp; turns into this perfect pie portion
A truly destitute person divests himself of "U", becoming this tree product
A synonym for "way" loses its "U", becoming this repetitive way of doing things
A device that dispenses water expels its "U", becoming this gem surface
