LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND
Things go south when they go here "in a handbasket"
A football running play, or when a plane's tracking is given to another control center
I heard it this way, directly from the original source
Proverbially, "Close only counts in" this game "&amp; hand grenades"
The ends are left hanging in this long necktie that uses a slipknot
