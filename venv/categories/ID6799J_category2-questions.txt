CIRCUS HISTORY
If this man hadn't changed his name, we would have had a Barnum &amp; McGinnis Circus
These famous brothers started as performers; Al, the oldest, was a juggler &amp; tightrope walker
Tragically, 2 members of this family died when their 7-man pyramid collapsed in 1962
This Frenchman invented the flying trapeze act &amp; had a snug one-piece garment named for him
This animal trainer who had his own circus called his 1933 memoir "The Big Cage"
