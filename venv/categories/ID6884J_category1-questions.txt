NEW YORK CITIES' NICKNAMES
This nickname for New York City was used by Washington Irving; Bruce Wayne put it before "City"
Poughkeepsie is "The Queen City of" this river
Slowly I turned... to this "Honeymoon Capital of the World"
Second only to New York City in population, this western port is the "Nickel City"
Sharing its name with a European capital, it was known as "Copper City" for its production of that metal
