<em class="underline">JEOPARDY!</em> WORLD TOUR
We wish you a merry isthmus as we travel from Las Tablas to Los Pozos in this Central American country
We'll start in Irkutsk, go past Lake Baikal, then up into the Arctic Circle; all are a part of this Russian region
We've landed at Suvarnabhumi Airport for a stay in this capital; we hear one night there makes a hard man humble
We'll head out of Regina, hit Moose Jaw, then head up to catch some northern pike at Wollaston Lake in this prairie province
Head from Mongo to Koro Toro, then cross the northern border of this landlocked African nation into Libya... or maybe not
