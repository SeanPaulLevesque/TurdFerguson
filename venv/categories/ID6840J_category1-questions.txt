On the <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-10-08_J_30.jpg" target="_blank">reverse</a>, the bald eagle in the Great Seal clutches <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-10-08_J_30a.jpg" target="_blank">arrows and an olive branch</a>, symbolic of these two opposites
Featuring balancing <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-10-08_J_29.jpg" target="_blank">scales</a> representing justice, this government department's logo also displays a <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-10-08_J_29a.jpg" target="_blank">key</a> representing authority
The <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-10-08_J_21.jpg" target="_blank">2 and the B</a> represent one of the 12 of these, abbreviated FRBs, that issued the bill, in this case, the one in New York
The <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2020-10-08_J_20.jpg" target="_blank">number</a> off to the right identifies which exact one of these metal sheets was used to print dozens of dollar bills at a time
