ANCIENT ROME
This largest Roman amphitheatre was flooded for mock naval battles called naumachiae
This "fiddling" emperor scandalized the populace by performing in public in female roles
Early Christians hid in these underground   tunnels during times of persecution
Statues depict Romulus &amp; Remus, the legendary founders of Rome, with this animal that nursed them
The curia, which still stands in the Roman forum, was the seat of this powerful government body
