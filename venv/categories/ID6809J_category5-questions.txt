SONG LYRICS
"Tiptoe to the window, by the window, that is where I'll be, come tiptoe through" these "with me"
"Isn't it rich'? Are we a pair? Me here at last on the ground, you in midair; send in" these
"Put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon; all I want is having you and" This! This! This!
"There's nothing left for me, of days that used to be; I live in memory among" these
It begins, "No one to talk with, all by myself, no one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf"
