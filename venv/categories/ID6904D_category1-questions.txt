UNICORNS
In a hit song by The Irish Rovers, frolicking unicorns fail to make it aboard this vessel
This mammal, the male of which may sport a 10-foot-long tusk, is sometimes called the unicorn of the sea
In "Toy Story 3" &amp; "4", Jeff Garlin of "The Goldbergs" voices this unicorn, also the name of a yellow flower
In 1840 the Unicorn became this British line's first ship to set sail; its later ships included the Queen Mary &amp; QE2
