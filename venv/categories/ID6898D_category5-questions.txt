CAVEAT SCULPTOR
It took three years from 1501 to 1504 for the marble work <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/media/2021-01-06_DJ_04.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> to be completed by this artist, but we'd say it was worth the time
Sir George Frampton did the statue of this J.M. Barrie character that's in Kensington Gardens
In a 15th century marble statue &amp; a relief, Donatello depicted this saint "Killing the Dragon"
In 1904 this Danish-American sculptor who later thought much bigger in South Dakota gave us "Mares of Diomedes"
In 1884 this great French sculptor was commissioned to create "The Burghers of Calais"
