MAD ABOUT MADRIGALS
A form of vocal chamber music, madrigals reached a pinnacle during this "rebirth" period from the 14th to the 16th centuries
The classic madrigal "Now Is The Month Of Maying" has plenty of fa-la's &amp; also rhymes "bonny" this with "greeny grass"
Enriching text with music &amp; vocals, madrigals often employed works by great poets like this heartsick lover of Laura
Madrigals were this "multi-harmonic" style of several vocal melodies
The music at his funeral left out his sad "Adagio For Strings" but did use a madrigal by his life partner Gian Carlo Menotti
